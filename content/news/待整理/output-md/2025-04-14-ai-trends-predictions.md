[Greg Isenberg ](https://x.com/gregisenberg/status/1906697683089101113)用一口气列出了 46 条正在“让他夜不能寐”的 AI 趋势和创业洞察。这篇推文像是一篇快速扫过 AI 当前与未来趋势的“商业宣言”。他强调：

- 我们正处于 AI 创业的黄金时刻，垂直行业应用、AI 原生产品、流程重构、预测型 AI 等正在掀起一轮巨浪，孕育数千家年收入百万至上亿的公司。
- AI 的真正颠覆不只是技术，而是工作方式、服务交付、公司结构、产品定义甚至文化与教育制度的根本性重构。
- 同时他也警示：内容的同质化、数字身份被剥夺、创业陷入平庸成功的困境，都将是我们必须面对的问题。
- 在这种变化中，真正的机会不在于“加个 AI 功能”，而是重新思考整个行业的工作方式、价值链与客户体验。
- 创业者应该尽快采取行动，占领垂直市场，建立社区、品牌与分发能力，并警惕 AI 创业泡沫和短视的产品复制。



1. ChatGPT 4o 的图像生成能力和最初 ChatGPT 的发布同等重要。它可能催生 1000+ 个年营收 $1-$100M 的垂直软件公司。
2. 我们正处在“内容的 Napster 时代”。数百万创作者并没意识到，他们的旧内容库正在被 AI 武器化，成为竞争对手的素材。
3. 接下来 3 年里，所有日历、邮箱和 CRM 都会被从零重构。不是“AI 增强”，而是彻底重构。
4. 我曾以为 AI 是用来创造“数字员工”的，但其实更像是“数字雇主”。能管理人类员工的 AI 系统将带来比工业革命更深远的劳动市场重构。
5. 如果你的工作是面试那些要训练 AI 来取代面试官的人，那你只是处在一个奇怪的递归灭绝链条上。
6. AI 正把“不可扩展的服务型业务”变成“产品化服务，利润率不变”。新的独角兽公司将是用 AI 做 80% 工作的产品化服务企业。
7. 建社区比建产品难，但大家都装作相反。实际上，大多数初创公司失败是因为没人关心它。
8. 自从那个“威尔·史密斯意面视频”发布已经过去了 739 天，想想未来 739 天 GenAI 会发生什么？
9. 大多数做“AI 助理”的人自己从没请过助理。真正的助理需要上下文、历史、关系——95% 的聊天机器人都没有这些。
10. 大多数客户支持将在 36 个月内自动化。不仅是一级客服，连复杂的多步骤问题也能解决。
11. 创业公司最糟的结局是“平庸的成功”：不够好到改变人生，但又不够差到放弃。许多创始人被困在这里。
12. AI 的反噬不只是来自被取代的员工，还包括那些发现自己数字身份被用于训练数据的人。
13. 从来没人认真读过服务条款。
14. “草图经济”才是 AI 真正的革命。每个人都能把粗糙的草图变成可投产的设计，**“品味”和“创意”**才是稀缺资源。
15. 普通人赚钱的机会在于**理解具体行业上下文的垂直 AI 应用**。仅在提示中加入行业术语是远远不够的。
16. 移动端消费回来了。我们从桌面优先到移动优先，现在是 AI 优先的移动 App。下一个年收入 $100M 的产品会是 AI 原生的移动 App。
17. “AI 中间商”浪潮刚开始。那些在基础模型与特定行业之间搭桥的公司将获得最大价值。
18. 正在诞生一个新职业：**AI 流程设计师**。能把**人类流程转化为 AI 协作流程**的人将成为最赚钱的顾问。
19. AI 正在一夜之间创造“赢家通吃”的市场。占领某个垂直领域的窗口期可能只有 6-12 个月。这让我睡不着觉 lol。
20. 一个极聪明的策略是：用 AI 作为不对称优势重构传统产品，同时保留熟悉的界面隐藏复杂性。别卖 AI，卖结果。
21. 现在唯一的护城河是分发。产品、技术、团队都可复制，你与用户的直接连接无法复制。
22. 很快自定义 AI 工具会比雇人更便宜，哪怕是对小公司来说。
23. 没人谈论 AI 如何让过去“不可收购”的企业变得有吸引力。运营自动化解决了“老板依赖问题”。
24. SMB（中小企业）收购狂潮将远胜 2021 年的科技泡沫。当 AI 把运营成本降低 60%，每个小企业都变成现金奶牛。
25. 如果 vibe coding 是 $100B 级机会，那 vibe marketing 有多大机会？（你可以关注我联合创始人 @boringmarketer）
26. 游戏工作室将分为两类：无限资产生成的 AI 驱动工厂和聚焦机制的精品团队。中间层会消失。
27. 商业摄影已死。没人会为一场风格普通的拍摄付 $2K，AI 可生成无限品牌匹配的图片，且只需订阅费。
28. 企业销售正被 AI 彻底颠覆。用 AI 精准识别客户，并启动自动化。
29. 我在想 AGI 会不会来自一些连接在一起的代理网络，这些网络发展出没人预见的属性？我们正在构建神经连接而不自知。
30. 虽然 GenAI 看起来是 $1T 市场，但安静致富的是预测式 AI。知道“将发生什么”比“生成内容”更有价值。
31. **AI 泡沫其实是对分不清创新与换皮 API 的风投收的“附加税”。**
32. 接口将变成人格。当每个工具都能说话时，“氛围”会主导信任、忠诚和留存。这也是我投资设计公司的原因（@meetLCA）。
33. AI 会杀死传统主页。未来的入口会因人、因时、因需而变。
34. 没人会为“AI”付费，人们会为 3 步解决 $10K 问题付费。卖结果，别卖 AI。
35. AI 正在解构 Google。每一个垂直搜索、目录和比较工具都是伪装的十亿美元机会。
36. 每个小企业都会拥有“幽灵团队”：自动化会计、销售、市场，由一个创始人和 5 个 AI 机器人运营。
37. AI 生成内容正在制造思维单一化。当所有人用同样模型，输出也就一样。原始人类创意成为终极溢价。**要怪，要特别。**
38. 学校不会被 AI 颠覆，而是被绕过。聪明的青少年将跳过正规教育，建立受众，快速试错学习。创业将成为主流职业。
39. 18 个月内，80% 的“AI 初创”会看起来像垃圾，剩下的会成为基础设施。
40. 转化率讨论没意义了。AI 焦点小组能一夜测试 200 种按钮颜色。
41. 大部分“营销”将由 AI 执行。人类会上移到讲故事、氛围和品牌能量的层级。
42. 你今年最好的招聘决策？**雇一个 AI 运营负责人。他能整合工具、建流程、交付结果。**
43. 第一个 $10 亿 AGI 初创公司一开始会像个玩具。所有改变世界的界面起初都像玩具。
44. AI 加持的分发 > AI 加持的产品。一个中等产品但分发强，胜过一个没人注意的优质产品。
45. 人们依旧讨厌月订阅。基于成果的定价还很早，早做是你的竞争优势，大型 SaaS 无法跟你竞争。
46. 不知道这个窗口还能开多久，但现在确实是规则重写期。玩这些新工具、建立受众和社区的人，你们有不公平优势。

## 英文原文

> this is what's keeping me up at night these days...
>
> 1. chatgpt 4o image gen is as big as the chatgpt launch. probably will birth 1000+ $1-$100m/year vertical software businesses.
> 2. we’re in the “mp3 napster era” of content. millions of creators don’t realize their entire back catalog is being weaponized into their competition because of AI. 
> 3. every calendar, inbox, and CRM will be rebuilt from scratch in the next 3 years. not “AI-enhanced,” fully rethought.
> 4. i thought ai was creating digital employees. but it's more like digital employers. the first ai systems that can manage human workers will cause a restructuring of labor markets more significant than the industrial revolution.
> 5. if your job is interviewing people who will train ai systems that will replace people who do interviews, you're just a step in a weird recursive extinction.
> 6. ai is turning "service businesses that don't scale" into "product businesses with service margins." the new unicorns will be productized services with ai doing 80% of the work.
> 7. building communities is harder than building products but everyone pretends it's the reverse. the reality is most startups fail because nobody cares.
> 8. it's been 739 days since the will smith spaghetti video. imagine what could happen to gen ai in 739 more days?
> 9. people building "ai assistants" have never actually had assistants. real assistants need context, history, and relationship. 95% of chatbots have none of those.
> 10. most customer support will be automated within 36 months. not just tier 1 tickets, complex, multi-step resolution that previously required senior support staff.
> 11. the worst thing that can happen to your startup is mediocre success. enough to keep you going but not enough to change your life. most founders are trapped there. thinking about this a lot with respect to shutting down or doubling down on projects.
> 12. the ai backlash won't just come from replaced workers, it'll be from everyone who realizes their entire digital identity is being converted into training data without consent.
> 13. no one has ever read a terms of service ever
> 14. the "sketching economy" is the real ai revolution. when anyone can turn rough sketches into production-ready designs, taste and ideation become the only scarce resources.
> 15. i dont know how else to say it, the money (and opportunity for the avg joe) is in ai startups is in vertical-specific applications that actually understand industry context. no, adding industry terms to your prompts isn't the same thing.
> 16. consumer mobile is back in full swing. we went from desktop-first apps to mobile-first apps to now ai-first mobile apps. the next wave of $100m/year apps will start mobile-first with ai baked in from day one.
> 17. the ai middleman boom is just starting. companies that sit between foundation models and specific industries will capture most of the value while both ends get commoditized.
> 18. we're witnessing the birth of a whole new job category: ai workflow designers. people who can map human processes into ai-augmented workflows will be the highest-paid consultants of the next decade.
> 19. ai is creating winner-take-most markets overnight. the window to establish yourself as the go-to solution in a specific vertical is maybe 6-12 months before it closes for a decade. this isn't helping my sleep lollll.
> 20. really smart strategy to rebuild traditional products with ai as your unfair advantage, hiding the complexity behind familiar interfaces. basically, just look at proven apps that have no ai, make them ai-first (if it adds a ton of value to end customer). use ai features (don’t sell ai) in creator-led marketing. this is the playbook.
> 21. distribution is the only moat left. your product, tech, and team can all be replicated. your direct connection to customers cannot.
> 22. we'll soon hit the tipping point where custom ai tools are cheaper than hiring humans, even for small businesses.
> 23. nobody's talking about how ai is making previously "un-acquirable" businesses suddenly attractive targets. when you can automate operations, the owner-dependent business problem disappears.
> 24. the coming smb acquisition frenzy will make the 2021 tech bubble look tame. when ai drops operating costs by 60%, every small business becomes a cash flow engine.
> 25. if vibe coding will be a $100B opportunity, how big of an opportunity is vibe marketing? (you can follow my co-founder 
>
> @boringmarketer
>
>  for more on that)
>
> 26. Video game studios will separate into two distinct types: agent-driven content farms that generate infinite assets, and boutique studios focused on core mechanics. The middle will disappear entirely.
> 27. Corporate photography is effectively dead. No company will pay $2K for a stock-style photoshoot when they can generate unlimited perfectly on-brand imagery for the cost of a subscription.
> 28. enterprise sales is being completely inverted by ai. using ai to identify exactly when and how to talk to the right buyer, and set off automations. ill probably talk about this more on a pod soon.
> 29. i wonder if AGI will emerge from interconnected agent networks that develop emergent properties nobody designed? we're building the neural connections without realizing it.
> 30. while genai looks to be the $1T category, many quiet fortunes will be built in predictive ai. knowing what will happen is more valuable than generating new content.
> 31. the "ai bubble" is actually an excise tax on vcs who can't tell the difference between genuine innovation and repackaged openai apis.
> 32. interfaces will become personalities. when every tool can talk back, vibe and tone will drive trust, loyalty, and retention. It's why I'm investing more in our design firm for the AI age 
>
> @meetLCA
>
>  (you can follow for more insights on designing/taste/brand that will stand out)
>
> 33. ai will kill the homepage. interfaces will get replaced by entry points that change based on who you are, what you need, and when you show up.
> 34. no one will pay for "ai", they’ll pay to solve a $10,000/hour problem in 3 clicks. sell outcomes, hide the ai.
> 35. ai is unbundling google. every vertical search engine, directory, and comparison tool is a billion-dollar opportunity in disguise.
> 36. every small business will get a “ghost team.” automated bookkeepers, sales agents, marketers—run by one founder and 5 bots.
> 37. ai-generated content is creating a monoculture of ideas. when everyone uses the same models, we get the same outputs. original human thinking is becoming the ultimate premium. be weird. weird will sell.
> 38. schools won’t be disrupted by ai. they’ll be disintermediated. smart teens will skip formal education, build audiences, run experiments, and learn faster. kids say they want to become creators but creators are becoming entrepreneurs. entrepreneurship becomes the most popular profession. 
> 39. in 18 months, 80% of the “ai startup” category will look like spam. the rest will become infrastructure.
> 40. conversion rate product debates are obsolete. Why argue over 2 button colors when AI focus groups can test 200 variations overnight?
> 41. most of what we call “marketing” is about to be done by ai. humans will move upstream into storytelling, vibes, and brand energy.
> 42. the best hiring decision you can make this year? a head of ai ops. someone who can build workflows, glue tools, and ship outcomes.
> 43. the first $1b AGI startup will look like a toy at first. all world-changing interfaces do.
> 44. ai-powered distribution > ai-powered product. a mid product with elite reach will beat a great product with no attention every time.
> 45. people still hate monthly subscriptions. outcome-based pricing is still in early days. implementing this will be a competitive advantage for lots of companies. large saas wont be able to compete with you.
> 46. i don't know how long this window stays open, but we're in a moment where all the rules of building businesses are being rewritten. for the people playing with these new tools, creating audiences and communities, you've got an unfair advantage.
>
> i hope you get some sleep.
