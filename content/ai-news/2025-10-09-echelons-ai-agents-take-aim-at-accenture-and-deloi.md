## Echelon's AI agents take aim at Accenture and Deloitte consulting models

Echelon, an artificial intelligence startup that automates enterprise software implementations, emerged from stealth mode today with $4.75 million in seed funding led by Bain Capital Ventures, targeting a fundamental shift in how companies deploy and maintain critical business systems.
The San Francisco-based company has developed AI agents specifically trained to handle end-to-end ServiceNow implementations — complex enterprise software deployments that traditionally require months of work by offshore consulting teams and cost companies millions of dollars annually.
"The biggest barrier to digital transformation isn't technology — it's the time it takes to implement it," said Rahul Kayala, Echelon's founder and CEO, who previously worked at AI-powered IT company Moveworks. "AI agents are eliminating that constraint entirely, allowing enterprises to experiment, iterate, and deploy platform changes with unprecedented speed."
The announcement signals a potential disruption to the $1.5 trillion global IT services market, where companies like Accenture, Deloitte, and Capgemini have long dominated through labor-intensive consulting models that Echelon argues are becoming obsolete in the age of artificial intelligence.
Why ServiceNow deployments take months and cost millions
ServiceNow, a cloud-based platform used by enterprises to manage IT services, human resources, and business workflows, has become critical infrastructure for large organizations. However, implementing and customizing the platform typically requires specialized expertise that most companies lack internally.
The complexity stems from ServiceNow's vast customization capabilities. Organizations often need hundreds of "catalog items" — digital forms and workflows for employee requests — each requiring specific configurations, approval processes, and integrations with existing systems. According to Echelon's research, these implementations frequently stretch far beyond planned timelines due to technical complexity and communication bottlenecks between business stakeholders and development teams.
"What starts out simple often turns into weeks of effort once the actual work begins," the company noted in its analysis of common implementation challenges. "A basic request form turns out to be five requests stuffed into one. We had catalog items with 50+ variables, 10 or more UI policies, all connected. Update one field, and something else would break."
The traditional solution involves hiring offshore development teams or expensive consultants, creating what Echelon describes as a problematic cycle: "One question here, one delay there, and suddenly you're weeks behind."
How AI agents replace expensive offshore consulting teams
Echelon's approach replaces human consultants with AI agents trained by elite ServiceNow experts from top consulting firms. These agents can analyze business requirements, ask clarifying questions in real-time, and automatically generate complete ServiceNow configurations including forms, workflows, testing scenarios, and documentation.
The technology delivers a significant advancement from general-purpose AI tools. Rather than providing generic code suggestions, Echelon's agents understand ServiceNow's specific architecture, best practices, and common integration patterns. They can identify gaps in requirements and propose solutions that align with enterprise governance standards.
"Instead of routing every piece of input through five people, the business process owner directly uploaded their requirements," Kayala explained, describing a recent customer implementation. "The AI developer analyzes it and asks follow-up questions like: 'I see a process flow with 3 branches, but only 2 triggers. Should there be a 3rd?' The kinds of things a seasoned developer would ask. With AI, these questions came instantly."
Early customers report dramatic time savings. One financial services company saw a service catalog migration project that was projected to take six months completed in six weeks using Echelon's AI agents.
What makes Echelon's AI different from coding assistants
Echelon's technology addresses several technical challenges that have prevented broader AI adoption in enterprise software implementation. The agents are trained not just on ServiceNow's technical capabilities but on the accumulated expertise of senior consultants who understand complex enterprise requirements, governance frameworks, and integration patterns.
This approach differs from general-purpose AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot, which provide syntax suggestions but lack domain-specific expertise. Echelon's agents understand ServiceNow's data models, security frameworks, and upgrade considerations—knowledge typically acquired through years of consulting experience.
The company's training methodology involves elite ServiceNow experts from consulting firms like Accenture and specialized ServiceNow partner Thirdera. This embedded expertise enables the AI to handle complex requirements and edge cases that typically require senior consultant intervention.
The real challenge isn't teaching AI to write code — it's capturing the intuitive expertise that separates junior developers from seasoned architects. Senior ServiceNow consultants instinctively know which customizations will break during upgrades and how simple requests spiral into complex integration problems. This institutional knowledge creates a far more defensible moat than general-purpose coding assistants can offer.
The $1.5 trillion consulting market faces disruption
Echelon's emergence reflects broader trends reshaping the enterprise software market. As companies accelerate digital transformation initiatives, the traditional consulting model increasingly appears inadequate for the speed and scale required.
ServiceNow itself has grown rapidly, reporting over $10.98 billion in annual revenue in 2024, and $12.06 billion for the trailing twelve months ending June 30, 2025, as organizations continue to digitize more business processes. However, this growth has created a persistent talent shortage, with demand for skilled ServiceNow professionals — particularly those with AI expertise — significantly outpacing supply.
The startup's approach could fundamentally alter the economics of enterprise software implementation. Traditional consulting engagements often involve large teams working for months, with costs scaling linearly with project complexity. AI agents, by contrast, can handle multiple projects simultaneously and apply learned knowledge across customers.
Rak Garg, the Bain Capital Ventures partner who led Echelon's funding round, sees this as part of a larger shift toward AI-powered professional services. "We see the same trend with other BCV companies like Prophet Security, which automates security operations, and Crosby, which automates legal services for startups. AI is quickly becoming the delivery layer across multiple functions."
Scaling beyond ServiceNow while maintaining enterprise reliability
Despite early success, Echelon faces significant challenges in scaling its approach. Enterprise customers prioritize reliability above speed, and any AI-generated configurations must meet strict security and compliance requirements.
"Inertia is the biggest risk," Garg acknowledged. "IT systems shouldn't ever go down, and companies lose thousands of man-hours of productivity with every outage. Proving reliability at scale, and building on repeatable results will be critical for Echelon."
The company plans to expand beyond ServiceNow to other enterprise platforms including SAP, Salesforce, and Workday — each creating substantial additional market opportunities. However, each platform requires developing new domain expertise and training models on platform-specific best practices.
Echelon also faces potential competition from established consulting firms that are developing their own AI capabilities. However, Garg views these firms as potential partners rather than competitors, noting that many have already approached Echelon about collaboration opportunities.
"They know that AI is shifting their business model in real-time," he said. "Customers are placing immense pricing pressure on larger firms and asking hard questions, and these firms can use Echelon agents to accelerate their projects."
How AI agents could reshape all professional services
Echelon's funding and emergence from stealth marks a significant milestone in the application of AI to professional services. Unlike consumer AI applications that primarily enhance individual productivity, enterprise AI agents like Echelon's directly replace skilled labor at scale.
The company's approach — training AI systems on expert knowledge rather than just technical documentation — could serve as a model for automating other complex professional services. Legal research, financial analysis, and technical consulting all involve similar patterns of applying specialized expertise to unique customer requirements.
For enterprise customers, the promise extends beyond cost savings to strategic agility. Organizations that can rapidly implement and modify business processes gain competitive advantages in markets where customer expectations and regulatory requirements change frequently.
As Kayala noted, "This unlocks a completely different approach to business agility and competitive advantage."
The implications extend far beyond ServiceNow implementations. If AI agents can master the intricacies of enterprise software deployment—one of the most complex and relationship-dependent areas of professional services — few knowledge work domains may remain immune to automation.
The question isn't whether AI will transform professional services, but how quickly human expertise can be converted into autonomous digital workers that never sleep, never leave for competitors, and get smarter with every project they complete.
